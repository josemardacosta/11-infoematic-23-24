                Websites are digital platforms accessible via the internet that host content and provide services. They are comprised of web pages containing various types of information, such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements. Websites can serve many purposes, including providing information, entertainment, communication, e-commerce, education, and more. Users access websites through web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari by typing in a web address (URL) or clicking on links.
URLs are internet addresses that pinpoint resources like web pages or files. They include parts like protocol, domain, path, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.
